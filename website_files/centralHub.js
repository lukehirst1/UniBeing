      "It sounds like you're carrying a lot right now. Try breaking your tasks into smaller steps — tackling one thing at a time can really help. 💙",
      "Stress is tough, but you're not alone. Have you tried the 5-4-3-2-1 grounding technique? Name 5 things you can see, 4 you can touch, 3 you can hear, 2 you can smell, and 1 you can taste.",
      "When things feel overwhelming, it's okay to pause. Even a 10-minute break can reset your mind. Would you like a breathing exercise to help?",
      "You're doing your best and that matters. Try writing down your top 3 priorities for today — sometimes seeing it on paper makes it feel more manageable.",
      "Burnout is real. Make sure you're not running on empty — rest is not laziness, it's necessary. When did you last do something just for you?",
      "Sometimes stress builds up because we say yes to everything. It's okay to set boundaries and say no when you need to. Your wellbeing comes first. 💙",
      "Try the brain dump technique — write down everything on your mind without any filter. Getting it out of your head can make it feel much less overwhelming."

      "When anxiety hits, grounding yourself helps. Place your feet flat on the floor, feel the weight of your body, and take slow, steady breaths.",
      "It's okay to feel anxious — it's your body trying to protect you. Would you like some tips on managing anxious thoughts?",
      "Try the 5-4-3-2-1 grounding technique: name 5 things you see, 4 you can touch, 3 you hear, 2 you smell, and 1 you taste. It really helps bring you back to the present.",
      "Anxiety often comes from worrying about things we can't control. Try asking yourself: is this within my control right now? If not, gently let it go. 💙",
      "Cold water can help during a panic attack — try splashing your face or holding a cold drink. It helps activate your body's calming response.",
      "Remember — anxiety is temporary. It always passes. You have survived every anxious moment so far, and you will survive this one too. 💙"

      "You matter, and your feelings are valid. Sometimes talking to someone helps — have you considered reaching out to a friend, family member, or university counsellor?",

      "Sometimes loneliness is a sign we need to reach out. Could you message one person today — even just a quick hello? Small steps count.",
      "You are valued and worthy of connection. If you're struggling, your university wellbeing service is a great place to start — they're there to help.",

      "Tired but can't switch off? Try a body scan: starting from your toes, slowly relax each part of your body working upwards. It's surprisingly effective!",

      "Starting is often the hardest part. Set a timer for just 10 minutes and work on one task. You'll often find you keep going once you've started.",
      "Try breaking your goal into tiny steps. Instead of 'write essay', try 'open document and write one sentence'. Progress is progress!",
      "Sometimes low motivation is your mind asking for rest. Are you taking proper breaks? The Pomodoro technique — 25 mins work, 5 mins break — can really help.",
      "Change your environment if you're stuck — move to a different room, go to a library, or even just open a window. A fresh setting can spark fresh energy. 💙",
      "Reward yourself for completing tasks, no matter how small. Finished one paragraph? Have a biscuit. Sent that email? Take a 5-minute walk. Celebrate small wins!",
      "Sometimes we procrastinate because a task feels too big or unclear. Ask yourself: what is the very next physical action I need to take? Just one step. 💙"

      "Progressive muscle relaxation can help — tense each muscle group for 5 seconds then release, starting from your feet and working up to your face.",
      "A simple calming exercise: close your eyes, take 3 deep breaths, and imagine a place where you feel completely safe and at peace. Stay there for a moment.",
      "Try 5-5 breathing: breathe in slowly for 5 counts, then out for 5. Place a hand on your belly and feel it rise and fall. Do this for 2-3 minutes. 💙",
